<h1>Discord Web </h1>

<p>Welcome to the "Discord" repository. I made a copy of netflix because I thought it would improve my coding skills for a copy of existing websites.
  
<h3>Only with HTML and Tailwind CSS.</h3>
<p>In this project, I only used HTML and TailwindCSS technologies. The reason I use TailwindCSS is that it conforms to the pixel-perfect design approach and feels more free. If you haven't used Tailwind before, I would definitely recommend using it with preitter.</p>

<h3>View and browse the design freely with the demo.</h3>
<p>I will share the demo link to see the design and browse comfortably. <a href="https://discord-web-ui.vercel.app/" target="_blank">You can click me to see the demo.</a></p>


<h3>Features to be added</h3>
<li>Pixel-perfect responsive design.</li>
<li>Dropdown menu.</li>
